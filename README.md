# Sample FHIR CarePlan Resources

Sample ðŸ”¥FHIR CarePlan and related resources for chronic care scenarios.

Because FHIR is still evolving there may be different versions of the resources:

- the `master` branch contains **STU-3** (v`3.0.0`) resources
- the `fhir_1.8.0` branch contains **STU-3** (v`1.8.0`) resources
- the `develop` branch contains (nothing at this time)

Diabetes Care Plan Scenarios
===================
These FHIR care plan scenarios were originally created to support the [Care Plan Track of HL7 FHIR Connectathon 14][track], held on Jan 14-15, 2017. The scenario scope and contents are expected to evolve and grow based on both clinical and technical experience.

The sample resources are based on a storyboard for chronic conditions that illustrates the clinical documentation used and created by care providers, and communication flow between a patient and care team members involved in his/her long term care. The chronic condition selected for the first storyboard is [Type II Diabetes Mellitus (Type II DM)](./Diabetes/Care Plan Storyboard - Diabetes Mellitus.pdf).

For the Type II Diabetes scenario, the FHIR resource files are divided into four folders:

- Patients: Patients, RelatedPerson, and other clinical resources
- Providers: Organizations, Practitioners, other related resources
- PCP: healthcare provider organization for patientâ€™s Primary Care Provider (PCP)
- Dietitian: healthcare provider organization for a specialist referral
- Podiatry: healthcare provider organization for a specialist referral

Initially, all of these provider organization resources are loaded into a single FHIR server, but we expect to distribute the clinical content so that each provider organization is supported by a distinct FHIR server.

Veteran Clinical Scenarios
===================
Description TBD


Loading these files into your FHIR server
-----------------------------------------
Each file contains a single FHIR resource.  A shell script is included that loads all resources into your FHIR server:

`$. load-all http://fhir3.healthintersections.com.au/open > log.txt`

or `$. load-all http://localhost:8080/fhir > log.txt`
