# Sample FHIR CarePlan Resources

Sample ðŸ”¥FHIR CarePlan and related resources for chronic care scenarios.

Because FHIR is still evolving there may be different versions of the resources:

- the `master` branch contains **STU-3** (v`3.0.1`) resources
- the `fhir_1.8.0` branch contains **STU-3** (v`1.8.0`) resources
- the `develop` branch contains (nothing at this time)


These FHIR care plan scenarios were created to support the [Care Plan Track of HL7 FHIR Connectathon 16][track], held on Sept 9-10, 2017. The scenario scope and contents are expected to evolve and grow based on both clinical and technical experience. Initially, all of these provider organization resources are loaded into a single FHIR server, but we expect to distribute the clinical content so that each provider organization is supported by a distinct FHIR server.

Each file contains a FHIR transaction bundle.  A shell script is included that loads all resources into your FHIR server:

`$. load-all http://fhir3.healthintersections.com.au/open > log.txt`

or `$. load-all http://localhost:8080/fhir > log.txt`
